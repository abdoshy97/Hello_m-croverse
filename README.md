# Set up a "Hello Microverse" project

> In this project, I set up a "Hello world" repository. The goal here is to master all of the tools and best practices I have learned about in previous steps. I will be using them in all Microverse projects and most likely in my future job as well.

This [link](https://questions.microverse.org/t/configure-linters-for-html-and-css/2009) is useful. It has two videos following the steps (there is no sound though).

## Built With

- Major languages
  HTML, CSS

- Frameworks
  None

- Technologies used
  Github, Git, VSCode

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- knowledge of git
- Knowledge of github

### Setup

- Create a repository, activate actions workflow. It will create a blank.yml file.
- Clone repository and make a branch.
- Create index.html, styles.css files
- link index.html with styles.css

### Install

- [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/).
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

### Usage

- Write the following commands to install [linters](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/clean-code/linters.md) (It could take a while for each one).

  - Install Stylelint
    npm install --save-dev stylelint@13.x stylelint-scss@3.x stylelint-config-standard@21.x stylelint-csstree-validator@1.x
  - Install Webhint

    npm install --save-dev hint@7.x

  - Install Lighthouse

    npm install -g @lhci/cli@0.7.x

### Run tests

- Test Stylelint

  npx stylelint "\*_/_.{css,scss}"

- Test Webhint

  npx hint .

- Test Lighthouse

  lhci autorun --upload.target=temporary-public-storage --collect.staticDistDir=.

#### Note: this command could be used to autocorrect styles.css

npx stylelint "\*_/_.{css,scss}" --fix

### Deployment

- There must be included node_modules folder in the .gitignore file.
- Stage, commit and push the files to github.
- Make a pull request and merge when all linters have been aproved.
